# twitterScrapperNoAPI

Tweet hashtag based scraper without Twitter API

Adapted from the book: 53 Must Do Pythong Projects For All by Edcorner

In this project I learned how to use snscrape to scrape tweets associated with a particular hashtag.
Snscrape is a python library that scrapes twitter without the use of API keys. -
There are two scripts associated with this project.
One to fetch tweets with snscrape and store it in the database (I plan to use mySQL Workbench 8. The textbook uses SQLite3),
One to display theÂ  tweets from the database. - Using snscrape, we are storing the hashtag, the tweet content, user id, as well as the URL of the tweets in the database.
